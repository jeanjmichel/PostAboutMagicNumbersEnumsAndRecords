Hi, I am Jean, an IT professional who loves studying about programming and teaching others the art of coding.

This is a basic study where I am using the C# Record type as an alternative to using Enums. This provides greater capacity and robustness at the Model layer.

I wrote about this study (in Portuguese) on my blog, you can access it here: :link: [jeanjmichel](https://jeanjmichel.medium.com/voc%C3%AA-scrum-master-pode-estar-tornando-a-daily-scrum-do-seu-time-uma-enorme-perda-de-tempo-e92980589894).
